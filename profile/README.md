We design, innovate, fabricate and test fixed Wing UAVs. The team's objective is to allow students to transcend themselves and sharpen their skills in the aero domain. The team is enriching this learning experience by participating in a hands-on engineering challenge at the Aero Design Series at the national and international levels.
